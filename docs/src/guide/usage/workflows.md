# Workflows

NiftyOne contains 3 primary analysis workflows.

## Participant

The participant-level workflow can be the most time-consuming process, with image generation performed here.

## Group

The group-level aggregates generated images for the platform. Additionally, if available, QC metrics are also aggregated during this workflow.

## Launch

The launch-level workflow performs the simple task of launching the visualization platform. If successful, a local IP and forwarded port will be provided to connect to the platform on your local web browser.
